# 🤖 InsightsAI — Data-Driven AI Prompt Engine for Business Intelligence

**InsightsAI** is a smart prompt-engineered web tool that transforms plain business queries into high-impact insights using multi-stage prompt chaining with GPT-4. Tailored for marketers, analysts, and strategists, it automates the process of turning data points into storytelling gold. 🚀 This project demonstrates skills in **Prompt Engineering**, **Generative AI (GenAI)** workflows, and **strategic content design** using LLMs.

## 💡 Project Objective

Enable users (even non-technical ones) to derive trends, competitive positioning, and campaign ideas from minimal input using AI. Aimed to replicate and enhance how agencies build insight reports — in seconds.

## 🔍 Core Features

- 🧠 **Prompt-Chained AI Flow** — each output layer feeds the next, creating a human-like reasoning chain  
- ⚡️ **Quick vs Deep Dive Mode** — toggle between speed and depth  
- 📝 **Content-ready Insights** — final output is styled like professional reports or social copy  
- 🎯 **Market-Centric Prompts** — trained on user behaviors, trends, and actionable analysis
